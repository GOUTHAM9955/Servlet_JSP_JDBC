<h1> JSP Web APp to generate Dynamic Response </h1>

<%-- 
  	We have to use <% %> known as scriptlet tag  
  	Whatever we write in the body of scriptlet tag it will be considered as the body of the service method and we don't
  	create a service method or request, response objects.
  	In the back end, the code will be converted as a servlet and get executed.
  	To print the response back to the client, we use the out method.
  
 	 We can use <%! %> declaration tag to declare an instance variable or method.
 	 
 	 Tag to import anything we use directive tag <%@ %>
 	 
 	 We have expression tag to print anything <%= %>
